The **masculine** is a possible value of [gender](genus.md). It denotes a [noun](nomen.md), [adjective](adiectivum.md), [pronoun](pronomen.md) that refers to a subject often associated with men by ancient Roman society. For an animate subject of undetermined or mixed gender, like a group of people, most Latin authors assumed the masculine gender, thanks largely to ancient Rome's highly sexist sociocultural norms.
