The **genitive** is a possible value of [case](casus.md). It describes the given [noun](nomen.md), [adjective](adiectivum.md), or [pronoun](pronomen.md) as the owner of another contextual subject. Additionally, a few [prepositions](praepositio.md) are attested to accept subjects of the genitive case.
