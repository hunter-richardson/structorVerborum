This website uses the term "numeramen" to denote the relationship between a [numeral](numerus.md) and the [nouns](nomen.md), [adjectives](adiectivum.md), and [adverbs](adverbium.md) it might derive. To do so, this so-called "word" inflects just like any other, according to the [reference](referendum.md) it contains.

Unlike other words, the numeramen itself cannot be added to a running phrase once it has been inflected. Instead, an method will be given to present the word that it references.
