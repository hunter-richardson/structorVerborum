A **noun** is a word that represents a subject. In Latin, most nouns are inflected according to their [number](numerus.md), and [case](casus.md). Latin nouns are segregated into three [genders](genus.md), although their genders are not specified here.

Additionally, a noun might represent a [verb](actus.md), often referred to as a [gerund](gerundium.md). For the purposes of this website, the so-called "verbal nouns" are inflected instead by their [reference](actum.md) and [case](casus.md). Gerunds are said to be in the [neuter](neutrum.md) gender, although other nouns derived from verbs are usually [masculine](masculinum.md) or [feminine](femininum.md).
