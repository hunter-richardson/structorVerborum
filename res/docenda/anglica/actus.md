A **verb** is a word that carries some kind of action. Latin verbs are inflected according to their [mode](modus.md), [tense](tempus.md), [voice](vox.md), [number](numerus.md), and [person](persona.md), although there are several types of inflection tables that restrict these attributes.

For the vast majority of verbs in a Latin dictionary, each term might inflect into several other inflectable words: [participles](participium.md), [gerunds](gerundium.md), and [supines](supinum.md).

Altogether these considerations make the verb easily the most complex type of word in the Latin langugage.
