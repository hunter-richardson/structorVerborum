A **pronoun** is a word that abstracts a noun, whether specified or implied by context. Latin pronouns are inflected according to their [gender](genus.md), [number](numerus.md), and [case](casus.md), although many of them are [ungendered](unigenerum.md).

Many pronouns act like [conjunctions](coniunctio.md) to introduce relative or dependent clauses, and so are governed by conjunctival word order restrictions.
