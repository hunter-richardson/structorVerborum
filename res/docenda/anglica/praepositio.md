A **preposition** is a word that introduces a prepositional phrase. Latin prepositions always precede the [noun](nomen.md), [adjective](adiectivum.md), and/or [pronoun](pronomen.md) they accept. This is one of the few reasons for word order to make a grammatical difference in Latin. Additionally, prepositions accept identifiers of a single or of several [case(s)](casus.md); although no validation is performed on this website for that.
