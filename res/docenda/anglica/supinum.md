The **supine** is a possible value of [reference](actum.md). It denotes a [verbal noun](nomen.md) derived from its parent [verb](actus.md) under [very special circumstances](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_syntax#The_supine). It is attested only in the [accusative](accusativus.md) and [ablative](ablativus.md) cases and is inflected like a [fourth-declension](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_declension#Fourth_declension_(u_stems)) noun from the verb's [passive](passiva.md) [perfect](perfectum.md) [participle](participium.md); therefore verbs without this inflected form also derive nouns inflected without a supine.
