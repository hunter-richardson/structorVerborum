The **locative** is a possible value of [case](casus.md). It describes the given [noun](nomen.md), [adjective](adiectivum.md), or [pronoun](pronomen.md) as related to some location, with context expected to specify how. Most inflection tables write the locative case identically to the [ablative](ablativus.md).
