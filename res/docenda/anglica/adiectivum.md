An **adjective** is a word that describes a [noun](nomen.md). Latin adjectives are inflected according to their [grade](gradus.md), [gender](genus.md), [number](numerus.md), and [case](casus.md), although many adjectives are [incomparable](incomparabile.md).

Often an adjective is used [substantively](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalization) as a [noun](nomen.md). In this case, the implied noun would be denoted according to the inflected adjective's [gender](genus.md) and [number](numerus.md) (and [grade](gradus.md) and [case](casus.md), if such attributes make a difference), or may be inferred by local context.
